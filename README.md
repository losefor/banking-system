### Versioning

Versioning, especially in the context of software development and APIs, brings several benefits that contribute to efficient collaboration, compatibility, and overall project management

## Production-Grade Tools and Libraries

To ensure the reliability, security, and performance of our Nest.js application in production, we should use the following tools and libraries:

- [x] **express**: The foundation of Nest.js, providing a fast and minimalist web framework.
- [x] **helmet**: Enhances security by setting appropriate HTTP headers.
- [x] **morgan**: Logs incoming requests and responses for debugging and monitoring.
- [x] **class-validator**: Data validation and sanitization to prevent vulnerabilities.
- [x] **passport.js**: Authentication middleware with support for various strategies.
- [x] **cors**: Middleware to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- [x] **pino**: Logging libraries for structured and customizable logs.
- [x] **prisma**: A powerful Object-Relational Mapping library for database interactions.
- [ ] **Memcached**: In-memory caching solutions for improved performance.
- [ ] **nodemailer**: Sending emails, useful for features like password resets.
  - [ ] Setup template system
- [x] **pm2**: Process manager for monitoring, restarting, and load balancing.
- [x] **helmet**: Content Security Policy middleware to prevent XSS attacks.
- [x] **jest**: Testing frameworks for unit and integration tests.
- [ ] **supertest**: Library for testing HTTP requests and responses.
- [x] **eslint**: Static code analysis tool for code quality checks.
- [x] **prettier**: Code formatting tool for maintaining consistent styles.
- [x] **swagger**: Documenting your API endpoints for easy consumption.
  - [x] security auth before entering swagger
- [x] **i18n**: Localization functionality.
- [x] **sharp**: Image manipulation library used for image optimization
- [x] **@casl/ability**: ACL authorization
  - [ ] Cache `ability` instance for recent active users

  - [x] Digital ocean upload files
  - [ ] Maintenance and Cleanup - Implement a routine to clean up unused or expired images from your storage solution. Set up cron jobs or background tasks to perform this cleanup.
  - [ ] Monitoring and Logging - Set up monitoring and logging to track image-related activities, including uploads, retrievals, and errors. Monitoring helps you identify and address performance issues or anomalies.
- [ ] **docker**: Docker image for the app
